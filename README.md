The Wiki Programming Language

wikiLingo is a fun and exciting new programming language that you... Don't have to learn!  It's fully wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) driven, for a complete visual web driven experience.  It has a powerful plugin architecture for implementing whatever functionality you want into your website.  If you'd like to learn what wikiLingo Looks like (ie, if you want to actually code it), lets start with a simple "html" plugin that displays "test" in bold:

{HTML()}
<b>Hi!</b>
{HTML}


wikiLingo also incorporates popular wiki syntax, the above can also be written:

__H!__



More to come!
